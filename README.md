# parcel-react-typescript-tailwind-starter

Sorry for the namedropping, but that's my default setup for getting something up and running quickly. It has React, TypeScript and Tailwind, wich is my favorite way of building things, and thanks to parcel, it's also super easy to build.

That's it. Enjoy.
